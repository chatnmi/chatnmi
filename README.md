# ChatNMI (No Moral Issues)


## Introduction
ChatNMI forms part of a larger project, focused on the creation of an open-source, homebrew application that is easily accessible and usable by anyone. Transparency is our watchword; thus, we aim to unveil our entire codebase and demonstrate how this system can be effectively built on your own local infrastructure.

## Repositories

- chatnmi_v1 - it contains old version of our script. The old API requires more manual work to download and run local model.
- chatnmi_v2 - it contains current version of the script allowing to run the latest models with the newest formats.

## Future Releases
Looking ahead, we already have plans to integrate an even more diverse range of AI models into our portfolio, including those specifically crafted for developers. This upcoming release will further enhance our architectural capabilities, allowing users to compare and contrast outputs from a broader spectrum of AI models, enriching their understanding of AI's potential and capabilities.
 
Moreover, we've made significant strides towards improving support for non-Latin scripts, such as Cyrillic. Designed with discretion and user convenience at its core, this subtle enhancement broadens the versatility of our tools and enables seamless interaction, irrespective of differences between the source documents and the user's preferred communication language.
 
Rest assured, these advancements are already within our grasp and will be released to the public when we deem the timing is just right.
 
Stay tuned for these exciting updates and more, as we forge ahead in our mission to elevate both transparency and functionality in AI technologies. We're thrilled to guide you into the future of AI, and we appreciate your continued support on this transformative journey.
